1. I think videoconferencing is primarily used for people around the globe to be able to communicate and work on the same things

2. In obvious advantages of videoconferencing i can put such things as high quality live video streaming, ability to use one application to solve different management tasks. Disadvantage of videoconferencing is that it is not really cheap. You need to have a good, fast internet connection and high quality web-camera to use "full power" of videoconferencing
